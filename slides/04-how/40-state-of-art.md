### Mutation levels

Selective mutation approach by Info Support's Jan Smits

- User choice depending on requirements
  - Type of project / domain
  - Pull request / nightly build

Mutation score not necessarily comparable!

- Full run of mutation testing as input
- Finds balance between accuracy and number of test executions

#### Project Xavier

Mutation levels implementation in Stryker JS

- **Hot off the press**: implementation done, [pull request #4686](https://github.com/stryker-mutator/stryker-js/pull/4686) open

Implemented by a project group of CS master students from the University of Twente

- Documentation to follow...

### Further reducing test runs

Analyze multiple mutants per test run

- Minimal number of test runs
- Combine mutants that do not influence each other
- No negative effects on accuracy

Current graduation project of CS master student at Info Support
